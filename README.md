# getSeatStatus

### firestore_recycler_view :
This android app retrieves data from cloud firestore database (https://console.firebase.google.com/project/firestore-recycler-view/database)
and displays it on the recycler view. When a new route is added in the *routes* document the list gets updated (not asynchronously though). To see the update open the app again.
